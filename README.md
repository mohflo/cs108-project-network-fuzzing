# cs108-network-fuzzing-tool
## Introduction
This tool can be used to evaluate the text-based network protocol of Java client-server applications such as the games implemented in the computer science lecture "CS108 - Programming Project".

It applies a man-in-the-middle-approach, relaying the communication between server and client and, depending on the configured tests, modifies the messages that are sent.

The tool works exclusively with applications that are started with the following syntax:

    java -jar game.jar (client <serveraddr>:<serverport>) | (server <serverport>)

## Usage

The tool can be launched with the following command:

    java -jar network-fuzzing-too.jar game.jar gameConfig.json

It will then run a series of tests, restarting game client and game server for each test. All communication and events are logged.

**NOTE**: The tool currently does not work on Windows. For further information, please check the FAQ.

### Configuration
The tool can be configured with a JSON config file of the following form:

    {
      "gameServerPort" : Int (e.g. 8880),
      "testToolPort" : Int (e.g. 8990),
      "protocolSeparator" : String (e.g. "%"),
      "commands" : ?String (e.g. ["GIVGL", "UPDAT", "CHATO"]),
      "ignoreCommands" : boolean (e.g. false),
      "specialCharacters" : ?String (e.g. ["ðŸ˜œ", "\n", "ðŸ‘€", "\r"]),
      "printLog" : boolean (e.g. true),
      "logModeCSV" : boolean (e.g. false),
      "tests" : ?TestObjects [
        {
          "testName" : String (e.g. "Relay"),
          "isEnabled" : boolean (e.g. true),
          "duration" : Int (e.g. 20),
          "value" : String (e.g. "0")
        }
      ]
    }

#### Properties
 - **gameServerPort**: Port on which the game server will be started.
 - **testToolPort**: Port on which the tool will listen to the game client.
 - **protocolSeparator**: The character(s) used to separate the commands in the text-based protocol.
 - **commands**: Which commands to test. All other commands will be relayed without modification.
 - **ignoreCommands**: If true, reverses the way the commands are filtered,  ignoring the listed ones and modifying all others.
 - **specialCharacters**: What special characters to check in certain tests.
 - **printLog**: If true, prints all logged data to the console.
 - **logModeCSV**: If true, logs the data in a CSV readable format.
 - **tests**: List of all configured tests.
 - **testName**: Name of the test. Tests not properly configured in the `Run` class will default to standard Relay Test.
 - **isEnabled**: Test will be skipped if false.
 - **duration**: Duration of the test. Afterwards connections will be closed and the game JARs stopped.
 - **value**: Value that can be used to further configure the test. Example: value controls the duration of the delay in the Delay Test.

An example config is included in the resource folder.

## FAQ

### How can I add other tests?
The tool is built with the idea of making it as easy as possible to implement your own tests.
There are three steps involved:
1.  Create a new method in the `Run` class, implementing your own test logic.
2.  Add the test name (String) and the method call to the switch statement in the `Run.checkAndExecuteTest()` method.
3.  Add the test in the config.

### Why does the tool not work on Windows?
This is due to an issue with the `Process.destroy()` method. On Windows machines, this method only kills the `cmd.exe` process but the child processes, such as the launched game JARs, keep running. Launching the game JAR anew afterwards does not work because the specified server port will still be in use.
